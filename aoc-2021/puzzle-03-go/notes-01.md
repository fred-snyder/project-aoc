## Notes part 1

The first parameter to check is the power consumption.

binary numbers >> gamma rate and the epsilon rate

The power consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon rate.
gamma * epsilon

## Gamma rate

finding the most common bit in the corresponding position

**find the most common bit, for every binary number in the list**

put together those bits form the **gammarate** number

## Epsilon rate

**find the least common bit, for every binary number in the list**

## Power consumption

SOLUTION: Decimal gamma * decimal epsilon
