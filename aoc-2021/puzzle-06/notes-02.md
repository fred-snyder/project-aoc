# Notes part 2

Suppose the lanternfish live forever and have unlimited food and space.

What does this mean for the existing code / cyclec? >> Nothing

Node.js crashes with `days = 143` (fish count day 142: 79532559)

However:
The description mentions the word: exponentially
perhaps we can derive a mathematical function from the days?

Goal: Find the exponential function. **THIS DIDNT WORK**

## Problem

Memory issues: 16GB RAM is te little memory for the solution I coded
Solution: try my other workstation (32GB)
